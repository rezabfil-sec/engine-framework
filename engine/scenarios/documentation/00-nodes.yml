# 0. Nodes
# Define and map nodes required for the scenario
#
# Scenario can be moved around in the infrastructure or
# updated after a re-wiring of the network more easily.
#

# ---------------------------------------------
# 0. Option
# Specify the settings for CPU Isolation

# Specify if you want to use the low-latency kernel
# Set to "no" or leave out if you don't want to use the low-latency kernel
(use_low_latency_kernel: "yes")

# Set the number of isolated cores. Cores starting with core 0 will be isolated. 
# Set to 0 or leave out if you want no cores to be isolated!
(num_isolated_cores: 3)

# Disable hyperthreading on nodes
(disable_cpu_ht: "no")

# Disable CPU turbo
(disable_cpu_turbo: "no")

# Set CPU to performance mode
(set_cpu_perf: "yes")

# ---------------------------------------------
# 1. Option
# Load the nodes for a pre-defined topology and its node mapping
# Empty string to use own definition

# A topology from the scenarios/topologies folder
topology: ""
# //
topology: "topo-01"


# ---------------------------------------------
# 2. Option
# Define your own required hosts and their mapping
# if the topology variable is defined it takes precedence

# A list with the required nodes with real hostname
nodes: []
# //
nodes:
  - otto
  - maggie
  - abe

# The mapping of the above nodes to node-X names
# the node-X names are used in the rest of the scenario configuration
node_mapping: []
# //
node_mapping:
  node-1: otto
  node-2: maggie
  node-3: abe
