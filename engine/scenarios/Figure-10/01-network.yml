    nic_irq_rt: true # Specify if the NIC IRQs will be set to real-time priority in the linux kernel. Requires the low latency kernel!!

# ------------------------------ TSN configs -----------------------------------
# NOTES:
# - number of queue items is fixed depending on the number of hardware queues (Intel i210 = 4)
# - available priorities for the prio list go from 0 to 15
# - all priorities need to be assigned to the queues, use '*' in one queue for remaining priorities
# Use queue 0 in a taprio sched for a guard band
# ETF offload can only be set for queue 1 or 2, limitation of the intel i210 network card
# ETF queues together with taprio must be used with txtime enabled or only special (timestamped) traffic works
#
# IMPORTANT:
# ! Queue priorities MUST not overlap
# ! Map all 16 priorities to queues or use '*' in one of the queues
# ! All taprio Schedule durations MUST sum up to a factor of 1ms
