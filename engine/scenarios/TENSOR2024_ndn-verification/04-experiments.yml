# 4. Experiments (combination of Network, Stack, Services)
# Actual experiments to run in the infrastructure.

# In this file all the previous configurations come together
# Every entry is one experiment that is run with the configuration defined in
# the configurations referenced in the network, stack and action variable.
# After all experiments are executed the scenario is finished.
#
# An experiment can be run in two different modes:
# 1. Time mode: A timer is started and the experiment runs for N seconds
# 2. Signal mode: Wait for services to successfully finish (e.g. send a fixed number
#   of packets, send all data from a dataset, etc.), when they are then they will
#   send a success signal. When all registered signals are received the experiment
#   is stopped.
# In both modes the experiment is immediately stopped after receiving an
# error signal.
#
# The default mode is timer, with a default time in roles/experiment/defaults
# When using the signal mode a maximum timeout can be specified when the experiment
# should be aborted regardless of the signals, if not specified the default timeout
# value is chosen from roles/experiment/defaults

# You can comment out experiments that you don't want to run
