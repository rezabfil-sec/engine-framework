# 0. Nodes
# Define and map nodes required for the scenario

# 1. Option
# Load the nodes for a pre-defined topology and its node mapping

# A topology from the scenarios/topologies folder

# 2. Option
# Define your own required hosts and their mapping

# A list with the required nodes with real hostname
