# 2. Application and protocol stack
#
# Services are usually a synonym for applications
# Services can be started grouped by nodes. The same service can be run multiple
# times, with the same or different parameters. The service parameters vary heavily.
# All available services and their parameters can be seen in the roles/services folder.

# Further information about services:
# Services are started during an experiment, the experiment can run in a signal
# or timer mode, both are explained in more detail in the 04-experiment.yml file
# In both cases every service is sending a signal to the experiment run script when it stops:
# 0 if the service finished successfully and 1 when an error occurred.
#
# In all cases if a failure signal (1) is received by the experiment runner the
# experiment is aborted.
# When running the experiment in signal mode, the experiment finishes only when all
# registered services send a success signal to the runner. To register a service
# the parameter "signal: yes" must be defined in the service entry. Usually all
# service are started with the run_service wrapper script that takes care of the
# signaling and sending registered signals to the experiment runner.
