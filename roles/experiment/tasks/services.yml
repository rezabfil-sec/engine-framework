# Start services in the current service level
# This file is looped on every node for all service levels
#
# Service levels are used to fulfill dependencies between services
# If a service relies on another service it simply needs to be put in a higher
# level than the service it is depending on: e.g. a server is started in level 0,
# a client that is accessing the server needs to be in a higher level (>0) to ensure
# that the server is started before the client.
